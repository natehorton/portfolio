<h1>9-12 Student Orientation Transcript</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>View of a Connections Academy student&rsquo;s bedroom and work area. There is a bed and a desk with a chair, desktop personal computer, printer, and writing utensils. There is a clock on the wall. Assorted shelves hold books and trinkets.</p>

<p>This could be any kid&#39;s room. It may even look like your room&hellip;</p>

<p>Zoom in to view personal computer on desk. A stack of comic books are to the right of the computer monitor. The printer is to the left of the monitor.</p>

<p>&hellip;but it just happens to be the room of a Connections Academy student.</p>

<p>View changes to show the top issue of the comics on the desk.</p>

<p>What better way to learn about new online adventures than through comics!</p>

<p>Zoom in to show the comic cover. The title is &ldquo;The Training Adventures of Zak and Zoey: Seeing the Site!&rdquo; and show our two characters, Zak and Zoey, smiling in awe of the Connexus website. They react to the Narrator&rsquo;s speech and greet the audience as they are introduced.</p>

<p>These comics are all about the adventures of two new students. This is Zak and Zoey. Zak and Zoey are brother and sister. Zak&rsquo;s in sixth grade and Zoey&rsquo;s in ninth.</p>

<p>The Adventures of Zak and Zoey tell the story of two new students, just like you. As you follow them through each comic you&rsquo;ll learn about your new role, responsibilities, routine, and all the resources available to you. Their adventures will help answer questions you might have before school starts.</p>

<p>But, as you can tell, these aren&rsquo;t just any ordinary comics. Zak and Zoey&rsquo;s adventures are interactive, and they&rsquo;ll need your help from time to time. There&rsquo;s lots of great information in these stories&hellip;</p>

<p>View transitions to desktop, showing the printer. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;so you may want to write some things down.</p>

<p>The screen dims. The printer image becomes the Printer icon. The icon is a top-loaded color printer with a single sheet of white paper loaded into it.</p>

<p>Print some pages, if you like, so you can take notes.</p>

<p>View returns to comic book on the desk.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also sum up some important points you can print at the end.</p>

<p>Zoom in to show the comic book cover at center of screen.</p>

<p>So go ahead! Dive in and start the first adventure.</p>

<p>The user is taken to the desk hub. Here the user has the option to either select the Printer icon to access a .pdf file for note taking or to continue on to the next comic/presentation by selecting the stack of comics on the desk.</p>

<p>The stack of comics is selected.</p>

<p>View of comic book on the desk. Zoom in to show the comic book cover at the center of the screen.</p>

<p>ZAK and ZOEY (in unison): Seeing the Site!</p>

<p>The comic book opens to show three panels with images from the issue. View zooms into the first panel image.</p>

<p>The screen transitions to a view of Zak and Zoey&rsquo;s computer monitor. We see the screen over the characters&rsquo; shoulders. The Connexus home page is visible on the computer screen.</p>

<p>The home page has a line of tabs at the top of the screen. The tabs are Home, Planner, Virtual Library, and More. Below that are the Today, My Courses, Links, and Announcements tabs. The My Teachers is on the right-hand side of the screen.</p>

<p>When Zak and Zoey start school, they will sit at their workstations, ready to begin the day. They log in to Connexus.</p>

<p>A thought bubble appears above Zak&#39;s head with an image of a tree log and a question mark.</p>

<p>(narrator laughs). It&rsquo;s their online school.</p>

<p>The image zooms in to show the Connexus home page at full screen.</p>

<p>Zak starts on his home page. At a quick glance, there are today&rsquo;s lessons,</p>

<p>A highlight appears on the Today tab on the home page. The Today tab shows a Welcome message and lists the student&rsquo;s current school lessons. The section has a Status column where a lesson is either Pending Approval, Complete, or unchecked. There are also Lesson Name, Assessment, and Course Progress columns.</p>

<p>things to be done,</p>

<p>The To Do List is highlighted. This is a list with links to necessary tasks such as lessons and orientations.</p>

<p>and teacher information.</p>

<p>The My Teachers section of the site is highlighted. This section is broken up by Homeroom and Courses. Each class has the teacher&rsquo;s name (along with a link to WebMail message the teacher directly), an &ldquo;i&rdquo; icon to access the teacher&rsquo;s information, and a &ldquo;LL&rdquo; link to access the teacher&rsquo;s LiveLesson session room.</p>

<p>The My Courses tab is selected.&nbsp; This page shows the student&rsquo;s current courses including their grade, course progress, teacher, and date of the last lesson.</p>

<p>The My Courses section shows his current courses.</p>

<p>The Links tab is selected. This page includes links to school resources including Course Placement, Data Views, SkillsTutor, Honor Code, CheckMyWork, Khan Academy, Discovery Education&trade;, Grolier Online&reg;, Peer Tutoring, and EBSCO: Student Research Center.</p>

<p>The Links section has school resources.</p>

<p>The Announcements tab is selected. This page is where students can find National and MyCA announcements.</p>

<p>The Announcements contain important school announcements, cool links, and useful tips.&nbsp; Zak realizes quickly that there are lots of places he could roam in Connexus. However, there&rsquo;s no place like Home!</p>

<p>Zak appears with a thinking bubble image of a baseball home plate.</p>

<p>Close enough, Zak.</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the first image and then into the second image.&nbsp; View transitions to Zoey&rsquo;s home page. A hand prompt appears from the right to select the Webmail icon. The icon is a large envelope with a sheet of paper inserted into it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Zoey checks her WebMail, her e-mail account for school contact between teachers, staff, and other students.</p>

<p>A hand prompt appears from the right to select the Webmail icon. The icon is a large envelope with a sheet of paper inserted into it.</p>

<p>The WebMail page shows the Inbox. On the left-hand side of the screen there are tabs for the Inbox, Drafts, and Sent Messages. A large &ldquo;Compose Message&rdquo; button is at the top of the page.</p>

<p>Zoey appears on screen with a WebMail icon with a number &ldquo;1&rdquo; on it.</p>

<p>Looks like you&#39;ve got a new message, Zoey! Teachers use WebMail all the time so Zoey needs to stay on top of her messages every day.</p>

<p>While Zoey checks her mail, let&rsquo;s see how Zak is doing.</p>

<p>View transitions to Zak&rsquo;s home page. A hand prompt appears from the left and selects the Planner tab at the top of the page. The scene transitions to the Planner page.</p>

<p>The Planner is a calendar that shows upcoming appointments, lessons, and engagements on the student&rsquo;s schedule. The current view is the Day view but it can be adjusted to the Week and Month views as well.</p>

<p>Ok, now we are in Zak&#39;s Planner.</p>

<p>Zak appears confused.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, Zak. It&rsquo;s overwhelming but you&rsquo;ll learn your schedule quickly. Here are your lessons and scheduled activities to do each day. The Planner is the perfect tool to help you stay organized.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey are doing great! They next make their way to the Virtual Library, filled with important resources, like their school handbooks, course tools, and school newsletters. They can quickly locate a lot of information here.</p>

<p>A hand prompt appears from the right to select the Virtual Library tab at the top of the page. The scene transitions to the Virtual Library page.</p>

<p>The Virtual Library has a Search field where users can enter the keyword they want to search for. There is also a list of links under the &ldquo;Categories&rdquo; section. Each link leads to a different section of the Virtual Library.</p>

<p>Hand prompt appears and selects the High School Resources link.</p>

<p>There are great career and college resources in here. Zoey, it&#39;s OK if you don&rsquo;t have all of the answers for your future right now. You&rsquo;ve got plenty of time. Just come back and use the Virtual Library resources to help you figure it out when the time&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>A hand prompt enters from the left and selects the Message Boards icon. The icon is a large pushpin. The page transitions to the Message Boards page.</p>

<p>The Message Boards page is a list of links that lead to individual pages where teachers, students, and other school personnel. The page scrolls down to show all of the links, including the teacher&rsquo;s homeroom message boards and class-based message boards such as Art, Math, and Science.</p>

<p>I see Zak and Zoey found the Message Boards. Students and teachers use these forums to discuss school-related topics and share class information.</p>

<p>A hand prompt enters the stage and begins to navigate through the message boards.</p>

<p>You can read and respond to your teacher&rsquo;s and peers&rsquo; comments. Message Boards are constantly updated, so they have great information to help you stay up to date with your courses.</p>

<p>Zoey works hard to get good grades and likes to keep track of her progress.</p>

<p>A hand prompt enters from the bottom of the screen and selects the Grade Book icon. The icon is a sheet of paper with an &ldquo;A +&rdquo; on it. The page transitions to the Grade Book page.</p>

<p>The Grade Book page has a table that lists the student&rsquo;s courses, their current scores and grades, teachers, and objectives.</p>

<p>Check grades and review feedback at any time.</p>

<p>A hand prompt enters and selects the Algebra 1 course. The page scrolls down to show the student&rsquo;s grades.</p>

<p>Select the number in the Points column of the Grade Book.</p>

<p>A hand prompt then selects the recorded grade on an assignment. The page transitions to show the completed assignment.</p>

<p>The teacher was impressed here. Great job Zoey!</p>

<p>Transition back to Zak and Zoey in front of the computer monitor.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey mastered their home pages at the end of the day.</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the second image and then into the third image.&nbsp; View transitions to a close up view of Zak and Zoey&rsquo;s desk.</p>

<p>Wondering what they&rsquo;ll learn next? Guess you&rsquo;ll have to keep reading to find out.</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the third image to show entire spread and then transitions to the view of the comic on top of the desk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user is prompted to select it to progress.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what Zak and Zoey learned today. Don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;ll get all of these notes later.</p>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user is prompted to select it to progress.</p>

<p>The user is returned to the desk hub. Here the user has the option to either select the Printer icon to access a .pdf file for note taking or to continue on to the next comic/presentation by selecting the stack of comics on the desk.</p>

<p>The stack of comics is selected.</p>

<p>View of comic book on the desk. Zoom in to show the comic book cover at the center of the screen.</p>

<p>The title is &ldquo;The Training Adventures of Zak and Zoey: Just Role With It!&rdquo; and show our two characters, Zak and Zoey, are playing in their front yard. They are throwing a ball with the Connections Academy logo back and forth.</p>

<p>ZAK and ZOEY (in unison):&nbsp;Just Role With it!</p>

<p>The comic opens to show the inside of the comic. There are two panels that show images from the adventure. View zooms into the first panel image.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey are playing in their front yard. They are kicking a soccer ball back and forth.</p>

<p>Seems like Zak and Zoey are having a ball.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey stop playing and give the Narrator an annoyed look.</p>

<p>Ahem&hellip;right. Anyway, it&rsquo;s great to see them enjoying the last few days of their summer vacation. Time to&nbsp;role&nbsp;along&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about&nbsp;roles&nbsp;as online students. What do you think it means to be a student in an online school?</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey start to think.</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the first image and then into the second image.&nbsp; View transitions to a cloudy blue sky with Zak and Zoey in each corner thinking.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey&#39;s responses to the Narrator&rsquo;s question appear in thought bubbles. They think of a video game controller, a stack of books with a red circle and line, an alarm clock with a red circle and line, and a &ldquo;ViewTube&rdquo; logo.</p>

<p>Those are very creative thoughts... Let&rsquo;s focus on&nbsp;school.&nbsp;Working online presents different challenges than traditional school. Zak and Zoey need to figure out their responsibilities as online students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New thought bubbles appear on screen and replace the previous ones. They have the following text:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Work Hard</li>
	<li>Ask for Help</li>
	<li>Respect Others</li>
	<li>Set Goals</li>
	<li>Do My Best</li>
</ul>

<p>Spot on! Zak and Zoey are going to do great. They&rsquo;re top-notch students. Online students are responsible for always doing their best work on their lessons. They&rsquo;ll make sure they complete their work on time and get the best grades they can.</p>

<p>Screen scrolls down to show Zak and Zoey playing in the yard once again. They resume kicking the ball.</p>

<p>Students also play a very important role on their learning team. Students work closely with their teachers and Learning Coach to develop goals in their Personalized Learning Plan. That&rsquo;s a plan the school uses to track a student&rsquo;s progress and to customize learning for personal growth.</p>

<p>Since Zoey&rsquo;s in ninth grade, she&rsquo;ll work with her learning team to examine her strengths and interests, college and career goals, and graduation requirements, and translate them into a high school plan that places her in the right courses. Planning for the future is exciting, huh? It&rsquo;s also important to note that requirements for graduation are specific by state and are noted in the State-Specific School Handbook. Zoey can discuss those requirements and her plans with her advisory teacher or school counselor so that by the end of high school she&rsquo;ll be ready for the next step.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t forget the Honor Code&hellip;do you know what that is?</p>

<p>Zak has a thinking bubble image of binary code.</p>

<p>Almost. It&rsquo;s an agreement with your school not to lie, cheat, or steal other people&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey give a thumbs-up.</p>

<p>Glad to see Zak and Zoey are both on board. It&rsquo;s important to read the handbook carefully because there are some actions that might not seem like cheating or plagiarism, but could have some serious consequences if they ever occurred.</p>

<p>For instance, copying directly from a website or looking up an answer online during a test are ways to get yourself in hot water.</p>

<p>Zoey reacts with a sad face.</p>

<p>Zoey&rsquo;s got nothing to worry about. She&rsquo;ll be sure to read her handbook. Right, Zoey?</p>

<p>Zoey smiles.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey read, understand, and agree to abide by the Honor Code. They promise to do their best work without breaking any rules.</p>

<p>The Honor Code is located on the home page of the Virtual Library in the Resources area at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user is prompted to select it to progress.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey now have a pretty good idea of what is expected of them as online students. What should we expect in Zak and Zoey&rsquo;s next adventure? I guess there&rsquo;s only one way to find out!</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the second image to show entire spread and then transitions to the view of the comic on top of the desk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user is prompted to select it to progress.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s recap what Zak and Zoey learned this time.</p>

<p>The Roles and Responsibilities summary page appears at full screen:</p>

<p>Roles and Responsibilities</p>

<p>Student Roles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do your best.</li>
	<li>Work hard.</li>

</ul>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user is prompted to select it to progress.</p>

<p>The user is returned to the desk hub. Here the user has the option to either select the Printer icon to access a .pdf file for note taking or to continue on to the next comic/presentation by selecting the stack of comics on the desk.</p>

<p>The stack of comics is selected.</p>

<p>View of comic book on the desk. Zoom in to show the comic book cover at the center of the screen. The title is &ldquo;The Training Adventures of Zak and Zoey: The Routine Machine&rdquo; and show our two characters, Zak and Zoey, busily cleaning their kitchen. Zoey is sweeping the floor with a smile on her face. Zak is dragging a bag of leaky garbage across the kitchen floor. He looks very angry.</p>

<p>ZAK and ZOEY (in unison):&nbsp;The Routine Machine! &nbsp;</p>

<p>The comic opens up to show three panels with images from the comic. Zoom into first panel image.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey are in the bathroom brushing their teeth. Their backs are toward the user.</p>

<p>Well, what do you know? I think we caught Zak and Zoey in the middle of their daily routines. Let&rsquo;s see what they&rsquo;re up to&hellip;</p>

<p>brushing their teeth&hellip;</p>

<p>The image transitions to Zak and Zoey sitting at their kitchen table, eating breakfast.</p>

<p>eating breakfast&hellip;</p>

<p>The image transitions to Zak and Zoey in their family&rsquo;s garage, feeding their dog.</p>

<p>feeding the dog. Their daily routine extends into their school day.</p>

<p>Zak and Zoey&rsquo;s face reactions change to confused.</p>

<p>What? You didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have to have a routine for school too? Yes, indeedy.</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the first image and into the second image. Zak and Zoey are standing in front of the computer facing the user.</p>

<p>Tell you what&hellip; Zak and Zoey already had their turn navigating Connexus. Why don&rsquo;t you give it a try?</p>

<p>The image transitions to Zak and Zoey facing the computer monitor with an over the shoulder view of the monitor which has the Connexus home page. Connexus home page becomes full screen.</p>

<p>Every day Zoey checks her To Do List. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The home page image scrolls down to show the To Do List.</p>

<p>Instructions appear on the top of the page. Text reads: You will be asked to locate and select an area on the screen. You will get two chances to locate and select the area, after which a prompt will appear to help guide you.</p>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user is prompted to select it to progress.</p>

<p>Text reads: Task: Locate an item on the To Do List.</p>

<p>A hand prompt appears on the Complete the Student Orientation link. The user is prompted to select the link to continue. The user selects the link.</p>

<p>Important things she needs to do show up here. Zoey, make sure you complete anything listed each day. They&rsquo;ll disappear as you complete them.</p>

<p>Next, check your lessons for the day.</p>

<p>Text reads: Identify where you can see the lessons you need to complete each day.</p>

<p>The user selects the lesson section of the home page.</p>

<p>The Lessons section of the home page shows which lessons Zak needs to complete each day. This is his biggest job of the day. He&rsquo;ll know that he has finished all of the day&rsquo;s lessons when everything is marked as Complete. Selecting any lesson on the Planner will take you directly to the lesson so you can get to work!</p>

<p>A hand prompt enters the stage and selects the Ed Tech 6 Introduction link from the Lessons section. The home page transitions to the Lesson Viewer.</p>

<p>This is the Lesson Viewer.</p>

<p>The course tree is highlighted. This is a list of links to individual lessons, divided by units.</p>

<p>The course tree shows all of the units and lessons in the course. Just complete the lessons each day as they show up on the Planner.</p>

<p>The icons in the course tree next to each lesson are highlighted. They include quick check and portfolio icons.</p>

<p>These icons indicate the types of assessments like quizzes, portfolios, and tests that are in the lessons.</p>

<p>Text reads: Task: Navigate to the end of this lesson.</p>

<p>The navigation icon is selected to move through the lesson. The lesson pages change as the button is selected.</p>

<p>The final page is an assessment with the following question:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How did the development of silicon chips impact computer usage?
	<ul>
		<li>They improved the operating system.</li>
		<li>They made is possible to use punch cards.</li>
		<li>They interpreted the binary system so that the punch cards were no longer necessary.</li>
		<li>They made is possible to produce computers small enough to fit on a desktop.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the lesson, there&rsquo;s normally an assessment on the last page.</p>

<p>A hand prompt select the second answer choice.</p>

<p>Great job!</p>

<p>Now, mark the lesson complete by selecting the checkmark button.</p>

<p>Text reads: Task: Mark the lesson complete.</p>

<p>The Lesson Complete button is selected.</p>

<p>A pop-up window appears that reads &ldquo;You cannot complete this lesson until its assessments are submitted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whoops&hellip;lessons can&rsquo;t be marked complete until the assessment is done. After that, mark the lesson complete and move on to other lessons.</p>

<p>The unmarked Lesson Complete button changes to the Pending Approval icon and is highlighted. This is a check with a small clock</p>

<p>The Pending Approval icon means the lesson has been sent to your Learning Coach for approval. So basically, when Zak has finished all of his lessons and they are all checked off on the Planner, he&rsquo;s done for the day.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a couple other things to keep an eye out for. See the Eraser icon?</p>

<p>The icon with a chalk eraser and chalk is highlighted.</p>

<p>It only appears when the teacher has changed the lesson in some way, like added notes or tips or changed an exercise. When you see this icon, make sure to review the teacher&rsquo;s notes. See the Thumbtack icon?</p>

<p>The Message Boards icon is highlighted.</p>

<p>The Thumbtack icon connects you to the Section Message Board for a course. Teachers will post important course-related information on these boards, like LiveLesson schedules, recordings, and supplemental materials.</p>

<p>The image changes to the Connexus home page.</p>

<p>In addition to lessons, don&rsquo;t forget to attend the day&rsquo;s scheduled LiveLesson sessions.</p>

<p>A LiveLesson is a virtual classroom. It makes you feel like you&rsquo;re in the same place as your teacher and your classmates. Zoey gets to spend time with her teacher preparing for tests or getting extra help if needed. These sessions are another important part of the daily routine. The teacher will let you know when to attend a session.</p>

<p>Zak appears excited.</p>

<p>Yeah, Zak. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;pretty cool.</p>

<p>Each teacher has their own LiveLesson room. You can access the session by selecting the LiveLesson icon by their name.</p>

<p>A hand prompt enters from the right and selects Ernie Math&rsquo;s LiveLesson icon in the My Teacher&rsquo;s area of the home page.</p>

<p>The home page transitions to a LiveLesson session. This is a collection of chat and video windows showing lesson content and student/teacher interactions.</p>

<p>During the session, the teacher may hold reviews or discussions, or sometimes give students time to share their views and contribute to the session. This is where students get a chance to speak with the teacher and the rest of their classmates face to face. Make the most of this time. Ask questions. Speak up. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to participate.</p>

<p>The LiveLesson session changes to the Connexus home page.</p>

<p>Text reads: Task: Check your new WebMail messages.</p>

<p>Look at that&hellip;another important task to do throughout the day.</p>

<p>The user selects the WebMail icon at the top of the Connexus home page. The home page transitions to the WebMail page.</p>

<p>Make sure you check your WebMail daily so you stay in contact with your teachers.</p>

<p>A hand prompt enters and selects the Home tab. The WebMail page transitions to the home page.</p>

<p>Well&hellip;that&rsquo;s a wrap!</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the second image and into the third image. View transitions to a close up view of Zak and Zoey&rsquo;s desk.</p>

<p>Looks like Zak and Zoey figured out their daily routine.</p>

<p>But what if they hit a snag? Where can they go for help if they have questions? Read the next comic to find out.</p>

<p>View returns to the comic panel image spread and zooms out of the second image to show entire spread and then transitions to the view of the comic on top of the desk.&nbsp;</p>
