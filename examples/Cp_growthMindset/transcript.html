<p>NARRATOR: You have the power to make your brain a lean, mean thinking machine! It is all about what you put your mind to. The first step is adopting the right mindset about learning and knowing that some struggle is good for you.</p>

<p>Do you think these students have a growth mindset, which allows them to be open to the idea that they can impact their knowledge growth, or a fixed mindset, which keeps them locked in their ideas that difficult challenges are impossible to achieve?</p>

<p>Two students appear on screen: a teenage girl, Norah, and a teenage boy, Garrett.</p>

<p>NARRATOR: Which student has a growth mindset?</p>

<p>The user selects the Garrett.</p>

<p>GARRETT: I&rsquo;ve told my mother over and over that math just &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t my thing.&rdquo; I get decent grades in Algebra but I just don&rsquo;t get the point of equations, graphing, and so on. I really dislike solving problems because these can be long and involved and half the time I can&rsquo;t even complete them. I want to be a writer, so why should I care about math?</p>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user must select to proceed.</p>

<p>The user selects the Norah.</p>

<p>NORAH: I have really been struggling with word problems in math this year. Determining which parts of the word problem are important and what is not needed to solve the problem can be really tough. I talked to my teacher today and she had some other strategies I can try to approach the problems differently. I really want to do well in this class so I am ready to tackle this challenge.</p>

<p>NARRATOR: The next step is to ask yourself, &ldquo;What is my mindset?&rdquo; If you feel fixed in place, it&rsquo;s time to adopt a growth mindset! The outcome can look entirely different if you can accept that frustration or struggles on a challenging topic is ultimately your brain growing, challenging itself, and getting stronger. You don&rsquo;t have to shy away from problems or activities that seem difficult or something that you can&rsquo;t figure out right away. Not all problems can be figured out in a just a few minutes. Give yourself time and enjoy the challenge of working through the problem.</p>

<p>When do brains grow the most? When you get an answer wrong and work to figure out strategies to correct the mistake. Think about trying new ways to look at or approach the problem.</p>

<p>Try some of these ideas to adopt a growth mindset.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Celebrate when you figure something out. You just strengthened your brain.</li>
	<li>FAIL is simply your &ldquo;First Attempt in Learning.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Seek support when you get stuck (a teacher, a mentor, a peer group).</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t expect immediate perfection from yourself. You are human; allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
	<li>If what you just completed didn&rsquo;t work, try something else.</li>
	<li>Keep your brain in top working condition &ndash; eat right and get enough sleep.</li>
	<li>Keep your brain focused &ndash; do calculations in your head.</li>
	<li>Break apart your challenges into manageable chunks of information so you don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed.</li>
	<li>Attach the word &ldquo;yet&rdquo; to your statements to unleash your potential.</li>
</ul>

<p>A growth mindset translates challenges into opportunities.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be open to trying new things. Remember, not everything will be or should be easy at first. Being good at anything takes time and practice. Remember that if you make a mistake, you are actually doing the best thing for your brain. You are helping it grow!</li>
	<li>Seek challenges and take risks.</li>
	<li>Focus on feedback that you receive, and ways to learn and improve.</li>
	<li>Achieving goals takes time, hard work, practice, and a can-do attitude.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a moment to set a growth mindset goal for yourself to complete in the next week. Apply the goal to something you are working on currently.</p>

<p>Type your goal in the space provided. Consider sharing your goal with your teacher, your Learning Coach, and even your friends. Sharing your goal will help to ensure that you will stick with it!</p>

<p>The user is prompted to type a goal into a text entry field.</p>

<p>The user must select the Submit button to proceed.</p>

<p>Onscreen text reads: You are on your way to strengthening your brain.</p>

<p>A Continue button appears on screen. The user must select to proceed.</p>

<p>Remember, you possess the power! The next time you are faced with something that seems hard or too challenging, such as a new math concept, remember that each time you work hard to learn something new or solve a difficult problem, you are exercising and growing your brain!</p>
